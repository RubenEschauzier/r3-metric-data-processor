Data is expected to be in the same format as output by the [JBR experiment](https://github.com/RubenEschauzier/link-prioritization-experiments) used to produce the results. This is as follows:

- `output`
  - `combination_0`
    - `interactive-discover-1`
      - `query_0`
      - ...
      - `query_n`
    ...
    - `interactive-short-6`
  - `combination_1`
    ...
